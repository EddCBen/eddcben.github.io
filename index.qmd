<div class="abstract-section">
**Abstract.** This research log documents the exploration of intersections between small language models, context-orchestration, and execution graphs. We propose a novel framework for cross-modality reasoning.
<br><br>
**Keywords:** *Cross-Modality, Execution Graphs, Context-Orchestration, SLMs*

  <figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Unified Neuro-Symbolic Architecture. Multi-modal inputs (left) are consolidated via an Aggregator before being processed by a Reasoning Unit (LLM). The Context Orchestrator then dynamically generates and navigates a non-linear Execution Graph (right) with curved symbolic pathways.</figcaption>
