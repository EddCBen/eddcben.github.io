## Bio

I am an **Independent Researcher** exploring the frontiers of **Local Intelligence**. My work focuses on **Context State Decoupling (CSD)** and **Neuro-Symbolic Architectures**, aiming to bridge the gap between deterministic software protocols and probabilistic reasoning kernels. By treating context as a structured graph rather than a linear stream, I build systems that achieve "Infinite Context" on sovereign hardware.
