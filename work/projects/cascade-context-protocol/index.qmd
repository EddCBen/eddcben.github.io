## Abstract

The **Cascade Context Protocol (CCP)** proposes a novel architecture for extending the cognitive horizon of Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond the constraints of fixed-length context windows. By treating conversation not as a linear stream of tokens but as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** of semantic intent, CCP enables "Infinite Context" through dynamic segmentation and recursive neuro-symbolic retrieval.

## The Linear Bottleneck

Contemporary Transformer architectures are bound by the quadratic complexity of their attention mechanisms. CCP addresses this by acting as a **middleware**, intercepting user input and decomposing it into atomic units of meaning before they ever reach the LLM. This allows the system to process massive datasets sequentially while maintaining a coherent, evolving global state.

## Core Methodology

### 1. Semantic Input Segmentation
Instead of fixed-size chunking, CCP employs a **Semantic Segmenter** that respects syntactic and logical boundaries, transforming unstructured text into atomic `ContextBlocks`.

### 2. The Execution Graph (Topology)
Each block becomes an **ExecutionNode** in a persistent Graph. This allows for non-linear reasoning, where input can spawn parallel tool executions.

### 3. Neuro-Symbolic Function Calling
CCP exposes a "Glass Box" tool use mechanism. Instead of opaque function calling, the Orchestrator queries a Vector DB for tool candidates and explicitly prompts the LLM for argument generation.

## Theoretical Framework

CCP decouples **Logical Context** from **Immediate Context**.
1.  **State Offloading**: State is offloaded to a persistent DAG (Hippocampus).
2.  **Localized Processing**: Only relevant nodes are retrieved for the LLM's working memory (Prefrontal Cortex), ensuring $O(k)$ context usage.

## Visualization

The architecture visualizes the "shape" of thought processes, observing segmentation, branching, and convergence in real-time via a verified dashboard.
